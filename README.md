<h1  align="center">Analisi della seconda ondata di Covid-19 in Italia</h1>

<h2  align="center">Data science lab project</h2>

The project consists in the analysis of the second wave of the COVID-19 virus that hit Italy from september 2020 to april 2021, focusing on the number of hospitalized patients. This time series analysis aims at testing different prediction methods to evaluate the future impact of the virus and, in the second section, a cluster analysis is applied to the series to group Italian regions that had a similar trend.

The data was downloaded from a Github repository, now unfortunately deleted, that updated every day the numbers about the virus, like infected, deaths and hospitalizations

You can check out the full paper (available only in Italian) describing all the steps in great detail at: [Analisi della seconda ondata di Covid-19 in Italia](https://github.com/andreamaver/DataScienceLab/blob/main/Progetto DS Lab.pdf  "Progetto DS Lab.pdf").

In the [Data](https://github.com/andreamaver/DataScienceLab/tree/main/Data) folder all the files used to create the final database can be found. The project was created using the R programming language.
